# 🫀 Heart Disease Classification with Decision Tree and Random Forest

This project applies supervised machine learning algorithms — **Decision Tree** and **Random Forest** — to classify the presence of heart disease based on patient health data.

## 📌 Dataset

The dataset used is `heart.csv`, which includes the following features:

- Age, Sex, Chest Pain type (cp)
- Resting blood pressure (trestbps)
- Serum cholesterol (chol)
- Fasting blood sugar (fbs), Resting ECG results (restecg)
- Max heart rate achieved (thalach), Exercise induced angina (exang)
- Oldpeak, slope, ca, thal

Target:
- `target`: 1 indicates heart disease, 0 indicates no disease.

## 🔍 Project Tasks

1. **Train a Decision Tree Classifier**
2. **Visualize the Decision Tree**
3. **Analyze overfitting and control tree depth**
4. **Train a Random Forest and compare accuracy**
5. **Interpret feature importances**
6. **Evaluate using cross-validation**
